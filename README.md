<h3 align="center">Hi! 👋</h3>

I work with software development, but I'm quite sure you already knew that (considering the site we are), so... what about more specific facts?

- I believe in and defend open-source! 🐐
- I see software as a powerful way to change the world and help us combat social ills. 🤝
- I'm a proud warrior for the glorious Horde! (FOR THE HORDE!) ⚔️
- I strongly value accessibility on the web and other platforms. ♿

Furthermore, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. 🎓
